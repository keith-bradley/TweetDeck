# TweetDeck
A program for getting informaion on bird sightings

TweetDeck is an experimental project I use to learn new (to me) programming ideas, algorithms etc.
At it's core tweetdeck is hopefully a pretty UI for intereacting with the University of Cornell's EBird system (http://ebird.org/content/ebird/)

EBird allows people to post sightings of birds that they have seen to the system. Other people can then discover what interesting birds
there are to view/photograph etc.
